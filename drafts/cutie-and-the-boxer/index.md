Great review. I'm dumbfounded that the current "top" review considers this movie funny. Noriko says that she would choose another life if she could. There is an aspect which makes their relationship not a complete tragedy. It is the notion that Ushio in his simplistic confident buffoonery had a personality that complemented the more analytical but less confident Noriko. Noriko is the type to stress over the preparation of
a meal and carry expectation about how it will be received. Ushio is oblivious but unburdened by expectations of his own. If opposites attract, then Noriko was drawn by qualities in Ushio she didn't have. I believe Noriko's early constitution is one which is easily dominated. She is analytical and open to self-doubt. Someone her senior so lacking in self-doubt, who till this day believes himself the "genius" to her "average", groomed that self-doubt. Amazingly, Noriko is able to overcome this. In the end Ushio is unchanged,
