I've been thinking lately about a trend in my own thinking.

For certain events I have a baseline for what constitutes a good experience.

Every morning I like to drink fresh coffee and eat a bagel. This is a baseline
for my morning. If I don't have it, then well maybe I'm a bit bummed out and
it's a negative.

This feels a bit silly, but it's all very particular. The coffee is brewed
well, the bagels have a chewy crumb, and I spread peanut butter that is ground
at the store.

I realized that I do all this for a neutral-to morning. It's what I have to do,
so that I don't have a negative morning.

something like toast or a bagel.

In what ways can I lower my expectations
