Richard Feynman asked this question.

Feynman played a significant role in the development of the atomic bomb. When
he volunteered, the U.S. government was afraid that Nazi Germany might develop
a nuclear weapon first. After the Germans were defeated, he continued to work
on the project to its conclusion.

Feynman wrote that he regrets not re-evaluating his involvement when his
original motive—preventing Germans from developing a bomb—disappeared. Though,
he writes that he may have continued working regardless.

As the bomb fell over Hiroshima, Feynman wrote about the contrast between
the suffering that ensued and scientists celebrating in Los Alamos. He fell
into a depressive state believing any construction to be fruitless, since it
would all be destroyed soon anyway.

Is the scientist responsible? I think not.
I think that is the wrong question. If the
scientist developed the bomb and threw it out (or never shared it), would they
have done wrong? If we agree that the use is wrong

For any moral wrong, you can identify an infinite chain

that any knowledge can be
used for good or bad, that knowledge is indifferent, morally agnostic. The bomb
can be developed and placed on a shelf.

Would handing off the bomb to a nefarious entity, be immoral? If you knew
they would not act immorally, are you responsible? Or are they still
responsible and just immoral? Was the creator of the first gun responsible if
they had the foreknowledge that morally dubious people would use guns for immoral
means?

Is there a moral wrong? Is it the suffering of cognitive beings? Isn't
suffering just our faulty hardware trying to save us from some immaterial
threat. Plants don't even know what it is like to suffer. In a universe of
plants is there a moral wrong?
