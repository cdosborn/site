            <p><strong>Day 1</strong>. Figuary is a month long drawing program hosted every February. I recently did the 2019 session, and am excited to do the 2020 session as it’s being produced. The instructional videos are produced by LoveLifeDrawing and the practices sessions by the Croquis Cafe. You can find the information <a href="https://www.lovelifedrawing.com/figuary2020/">here</a>. Here’s my first day. Still getting used to drawing on a tablet. <image style="width:100%" src="/images/figuary-2020-day-1.png"/></p>
<p><strong>Day 2</strong>. Today I decided to select some of the drawings and overlay the actual model. I tended to not make the horiontal poses wide enough, and I’m drawing the neck too long. <image style="width:100%" src="/images/figuary-2020-day-2-review.png"/></p>
<p><strong>Day 3</strong>. Today’s session began with five fifteen second poses. In the really short ones, there are quite a few line pairs that should converge but diverge (and vice versa). Some of the later poses have good balance. I could probably slow down and make more deliberate longer strokes, I’m noticing many disconnected edges. I thought I did better in the one minutes poses than the five minutes pose. <image style="width:100%" src="/images/figuary-2020-day-3.png"/></p>
<p><strong>Day 4</strong>. Today’s session featured the first male model. I’m consistently drawing the head too large. Overall pretty happy with the balance of each pose. I did lose the tension in the pose where the model is pulling the rope. <image style="width:100%" src="/images/figuary-2020-day-4.review.png"/></p>
<p><strong>Day 5</strong>. Dialed the head size back a bit. I like how geometric some of these turned out. Spent an hour or so on the rendered head. Just pretend the ear doesn’t exist. <image style="width:100%" src="/images/figuary-2020-day-5.jpg"/></p>
<p><strong>Day 6</strong>. Enjoyed this session’s poses, was in a hurry and would have liked to spend more time. I’m having a hard time using the brush dynamics. Should probably stick to something simpler. <image style="width:100%" src="/images/figuary-2020-day-6.png"/></p>
<p><strong>Day 7</strong>. Today I had a hard time with several poses (specifically the third and fifth). I had success with the last pose, even though there was significant foreshortening. When I saw the last pose, I could easily identify large shapes. Whereas in the pose before, it felt like one large shape that depended on getting the nuance right. <image style="width:100%" src="/images/figuary-2020-day-7.jpg"/></p>
<p>I made several more attempts. <image style="width:100%" src="/images/figuary-2020-day-7-review.jpg"/></p>
<p><strong>Day 8</strong>. In my mind’s eye, I was seeing a larger torso. Paused the clock for the last pose, and happy with the result. The legs are messy but it feels believable. <image style="width:100%" src="/images/figuary-2020-day-8.jpg"/></p>
<p><strong>Day 9</strong>. Unhappy with the last pose. I’m using dark strokes to “correct” previous lines that just end up being distracting. Happy with some of the two minute poses. <image style="width:100%" src="/images/figuary-2020-day-9.jpg"/></p>
