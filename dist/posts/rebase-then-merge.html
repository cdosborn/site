            <p><em>This is a niche technical post on the software development tool <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a>.</em></p>
<p>When you need to incorporate commits into your branch, you can perform a merge or you can perform a rebase. In a rebase, you’re constructing a new branch with your commits appended to the end. By appending, you’re left with a longer strand of commits. When you merge, the two histories are kept distinct.</p>
<p>In this post, I’ll argue why you should only create “logical” merge commits–merge commits that introduce no new changes, but join branches together.</p>
<p>Suppose you’re tasked with incorporating both these features into <code>master</code>.</p>
<pre><code>          o---o  feature-a
         /
o---o---o---o---o  master
     \
      o---o---o  feature-b
</code></pre>
<p>In a rebase and merge approach, you take <code>feature-a</code> rebase (move the base of it) to <code>master</code>.</p>
<pre><code>                  o---o  feature-a
                 /
o---o---o---o---o  master
</code></pre>
<p>Now its possible that this move will require some manual intervention. The rebase operation reconstructs the branch a commit at a time. Suppose we have <code>A</code> the first commit of <code>feature-a</code>. How does git construct <code>A'</code> this first migrated commit?</p>
<pre><code>           A       A&#39;
          o       o
         /       /
o---o---o---o---o  master
</code></pre>
<p>Git first looks at <code>C</code> the common ancestor of <code>A</code> and <code>master</code>, the last commit each had in common. Then Git compares all <code>A</code>’s changes and all <code>master</code>’s changes since <code>C</code>.</p>
<pre><code>           A
          o
         /
o---o---o---o---o  master
       C
</code></pre>
<p>If the <code>C</code> to <code>A</code> changes overlap with the <code>C</code> to <code>master</code> changes, then Git considers those changes conflicting.</p>
<p>If you resolve the conflicts and continue the rebase, git will have reconstructed the commit at the new location.</p>
<pre><code>           A       A&#39;
          o       o
         /       /
o---o---o---o---o  master
</code></pre>
<p>Git repeats this process for each additional commit. In order to bring over commit <code>B</code> on top of <code>A'</code>, Git will identify their common ancestor then see if the changes from <code>C</code> to <code>B</code> overlap with the changes from <code>C</code> to <code>A'</code>.</p>
<pre><code>               B   A&#39;
          o---o   o
         /       /
o---o---o---o---o  master
       C
</code></pre>
<p>If the changes do not overlap, then a new commit is created containing both sets of changes.</p>
<pre><code>               B       B&#39;
          o---o   o---o
         /       /
o---o---o---o---o  master
</code></pre>
<p>After the rebase of <code>feature-a</code>, you’ll want to merge this into <code>master</code>. When you perform this merge, Git will by default not create a merge commit. It will perform a fast-forward merge resulting in the following graph.</p>
<pre><code>                  o---o  feature-a, master
                 /
o---o---o---o---o
</code></pre>
<p>You can instruct git to create the commit (see <code>--no-ff</code>) <a style="text-decoration:none" id="fn:1" href="#fn:1:defn"><sup>1</sup></a>. In either approach, master will contain the same changes. However, constructing the merge commit preserves the history of the branch in the graph itself. For example, in the above graph <code>master</code> records no history of a feature distinct from its own history, whereas that information is captured below.</p>
<pre><code>                  o---o feature-a
                 /     \
o---o---o---o---o-------o  master
</code></pre>
<p>If you repeat this process for <code>feature-b</code> you should expect a graph like so:</p>
<pre><code>                  o---o feature-a
                 /     \
o---o---o---o---o-------o-----------o master
                         \         /
                          o---o---o feature-b
</code></pre>
<p>Following this pattern for all work will produce a <code>master</code> that is just a series of merge commits. I’ve seen this pattern used where each feature is squashed into a single commit prior to merge–this makes sense when the commits are not particularly useful.</p>
<p>Most importantly, work is never introduced into the merge commits. Each merge commit should be identical to the last commit of the feature, except that it has two parents. If you want to copy a feature, you just copy the commits of the feature.</p>
<p>Otherwise, a merge commit tends to resolve all the conflicts at once between two branches. This can be error prone–leading to new work being added, or existing work accidentally omitted.</p>
<p>It’s possible to use merges only to indicate logical changes (defining when a branch ends) and leave the rest to rebase.</p>

    You can change git's default behavior, so that merge commits are always
    created, with this entry in your <code>~/.gitconfig</code>
    <pre><code>[merge]
      ff = false</pre></code>
