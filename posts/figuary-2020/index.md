**Day 1**. Figuary is a month long drawing program hosted every February. I recently did the 2019 session, and am excited to do the 2020 session as it's being produced. The instructional videos are produced by LoveLifeDrawing and the practices sessions by the Croquis Cafe. You can find the information [here](https://www.lovelifedrawing.com/figuary2020/). Here's my first day. Still getting used to drawing on a tablet.

**Day 2**.
Today I decided to select some of the drawings and overlay the actual model. I
tended to not make the horiontal poses wide enough, and I'm drawing the neck
too long.

**Day 3**.
Today's session began with five fifteen second poses. In the really short
ones, there are quite a few line pairs that should converge but diverge (and
vice versa). Some of the later poses have good balance. I could probably slow
down and make more deliberate longer strokes, I'm noticing many disconnected
edges. I thought I did better in the one minutes poses than the five minutes
pose.

**Day 4**.
Today's session featured the first male model. I'm consistently drawing the
head too large. Overall pretty happy with the balance of each pose. I did lose
the tension in the pose where the model is pulling the rope.

**Day 5**.
Dialed the head size back a bit. I like how geometric some of these turned
out. Spent an hour or so on the rendered head. Just pretend the ear doesn't
exist.

**Day 6**. Enjoyed this session's poses, was in a hurry and would have liked
to spend more time. I'm having a hard time using the brush dynamics. Should
probably stick to something simpler.

**Day 7**. Today I had a hard time with several poses (specifically the third
and fifth). I had success with the last pose, even though there was
significant foreshortening. When I saw the last pose, I could easily identify
large shapes. Whereas in the pose before, it felt like one large shape that
depended on getting the nuance right.

I made several more attempts.

**Day 8**.
In my mind's eye, I was seeing a larger torso. Paused the clock for the last
pose, and happy with the result. The legs are messy but it feels believable.

**Day 9**. Unhappy with the last pose. I'm using dark strokes
to "correct" previous lines that just end up being distracting. Happy with
some of the two minute poses.
