**Day 1**. Figuary is a month long drawing program hosted every February. I recently did the 2019 session, and am excited to do the 2020 session as it's being produced. The instructional videos are produced by LoveLifeDrawing and the practices sessions by the Croquis Cafe. You can find the information [here](https://www.lovelifedrawing.com/figuary2020/). Here's my first day. Still getting used to drawing on a tablet.

**Day 2**.
Today I decided to select some of the drawings and overlay the actual model. I
tended to not make the horiontal poses wide enough, and I'm drawing the neck
too long.
