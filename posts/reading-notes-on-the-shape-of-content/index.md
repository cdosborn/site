*The Shape of Content* is written by Ben Shawn, an artist who began lecturing
on art, when it was uncertain whether art belonged at the university.

He discusses the challenges an art program can face at the university, his
approach to developing a painting, the fundamental nature of art, and advice
for the aspiring artist.

Here are some passages that I thought about.

> I had long carried in my mind that famous critical credo of Clive Bell’s,
> “The representative element in a work of art may or may not be harmful, but

> us nothing from life, no knowledge of its affairs and ideas, no familiarity
> with its emotions.”

Clive Bell is arguing that it is the _form_ (appearance, shape, color) which
is significant. What about the *meaning* of a painting? What about what it
*represents*?

Bell describes how some paintings just convey information. Perhaps the
painting depicts a terrible scene and causes you to feel remorse. Or perhaps
the painting is a snapshot of intimate family life in a bygone time. In each
of these cases, the painting could be translated into written form and the
effect would be the same. To Bell, these forms of art are purely
communicative, he argues that the greatest works rest on their form alone, not
on the ideas they communicate<a style="text-decoration:none" id="fn:1" href="#fn:1:defn"><sup>1</sup></a>.

Shawn describes art as having two parts: content and form. Content is an idea
lacking a representation. Form is that representation—the shape of content.
His last remark is significant in light of approaches to art which try and
free themselves completely of content.

Art is subjective. Nothing about the universe, no amount of collecting facts
will ever determine that some form is good or bad. You have to hoist art upon
values you already have in place. For example, when you’re learning to draw,
one of your values is photo-realism. Each of your drawings is good whether or
not it is realistic. If you experience a piece of art and you don’t know how
to react to it, you just need to discover a value system that will enable you
to appreciate it.

Art began a phase of freeing itself from meaning, because it felt constrained
by meaning. But Shawn is feeling constrained that he cannot create a
meaning-driven painting. So Shawn is advocating for a phase which permits
meaning.
