How do we explain so many people wanting to change and not changing?

> Simply put, people have various complaints about things, but it's easier and
more secure to be just the way one is ... When we try to change our lifestyles,
we put our great courage to the test.

> No experience is in itself a cause of our success or failure. We do not
suffer from the shock of our experiences--the so-called trauma--but instead we
make out of them whatever suits our purposes. We are not determined by our
experiences, but the meaning we give them is self-determining.

> We are all suffering in interpersonal relationships. It might be the
relationship with one's parents or one's elder brother, and it might be the
interpersonal relationships at one's workplace ... Calmly delineate up to what
point one's own tasks go, and from what point they become another person's
tasks. And do not intervene in other people's tasks, or allow even a single
person to intervene in one's own tasks.

> What should one do to not be disliked by anyone? There is only one answer: It
is to constantly gauge other people's feelings while swearing loyalty to all of
them ... If one is living in such a way as to satisfy other people's
expectations, and one is entrusting one's own life to others, that is a way of
living in which one is lying to oneself and continuing that lying to include
the people around one.

> A mother praises her child who has helped her prepare dinner, saying, "You're
such a good helper!" But when her husband does the same things, you can be sure
she won't be telling him, "you're such a good helper!" ... In other words, the
mother who praises the child ... is unconsciously creating a hierarchical
relationship and seeing the child as beneath her ... When one person praises
another, the goal is "to manipulate someone who has less ability than you." it
is not done out of gratitude or respect.

> Being praised essentially means that one is receiving judgement from another
person as "good," and the measure of what is good or bad about that act is that
person's yardstick ... "Thank you," on the other hand, rather than being
judgment , is a clear expression of gratitude. When one hears words of
gratitude, one know that one has made a contribution to another person.

> For a human being, the greatest unhappiness is not being able to like
oneself. Adler came up with an extremely simple answer to address this reality.
Namely, that the feeling of "I am beneficial to the community" or "I am of use
to someone" is the only thing that can give one a true awareness that one has
worth ... You are not the one who decides if your contributions are of use.
That is the task of other people, and is not an issue in which you can
intervene. In principle, there is not even any way you can know whether you
have really made a contribution. That is to say, when we are engaging in this
contribution to others, the contribution does not have to be a visible one—all
we need is the subjective sense that "I am of use to someone," or in other
words, a feeling of contribution.

> You set objectives for the distant future, and think of now as your
preparatory period. You think. "I really want to do this, and I'll do it when
the time comes." This is is a way of living that postpones life. As long was we
postpone life, we can never go anywhere and will pass our days only one after
the next in dull monotony, because we think of here and now as just a
preparatory period, as a time for patience ... The greatest life-lie of all is
to not live here and now.

> What is the meaning of life? What are people living for? When someone posed
these questions to Adler, this was his answer: "Life in general has no
meaning." ... During the war, my grandfather was firebombed, and his face was
severely burned. In every way, it was a horrendous and inhumane event. It would
certainly have been within the realm of possibility for him to choose a
lifestyle with the perspective of "the world is a horrible place" or "people
are my enemies." however, when my grandfather rode the train on visits to the
hospital , there were always other passengers who would give up their seats for
him. This is something I heard about through my mother, so I do not know he
actually felt. But this is what I believe: My grandfather chose a lifestyle
with the perspective of "People are my comrades, and the world is a wonderful
place." That is exactly what Adler is pointing to when he says whatever meaning
life has must be assigned to it by the individual. So life in general has no
meaning whatsoever. But you can assign meaning to that life. And you are the
only one who can assign meaning to your life.

> When one attempts to choose freedom, it is only natural that one may lose
one's way. At this juncture, Adlerian psychology holds up a "guiding star" as a
grand compass pointing to a life of freedom ... It is an expansive ideal that
says, as long as we do not lose sight of this compass and keep on moving in
this direction, there is happiness ... It is contribution to others ... No
matter what moments you are living, or if there are people who dislike you, as
long as you do not lose sight of the guiding star of "I contribute to others,"
you will not lose your way, and you can do whatever you like. Whether you're
disliked or not, you pay it no mind and live free.

> There is no escape from your subjectivity.

> No experience is in itself a cause of our success or failure. We do not
suffer from the shock of our experiences--the so-called trauma--but instead we
make out of them whatever suits our purposes. We are not determined by our
experiences, but the meaning we give them is self-determining.

Humans cannot do something they don't want to. Humans always do what they find
is in their best interest. So it is as simple as asking why does someone want
to be unhappy. Choosing happiness is not easy. It requires courage. Doing
things that would make you happy can hurt you. Choosing to be unhappy mitigates
the risk but also mitigates the reward.

> Although there are some small inconveniences and limitations, you probably
think that the lifestyle you have now is the most practical one, and that it's
easier to leave things as they are. If you stay just like this, experience
enables you to respond properly to events as they occur, while guessing the
results of one's actions. You could say it's like driving your old, familiar
car. It might rattle a bit, but one can take that into account and maneuver
easily. On the other hand, if one chooses a new lifestyle, no one can predict
what might happen to the new self, or have any idea how to deal with events as
they arise. It will be hard to see ahead to the future, and life will be filled
with anxiety. A more painful and unhappy life might lie ahead. Simply put,
people have various complaints about things, but it's easier and more secure to
be just the way one is ... When we try to change our lifestyles, we put our
great courage to the test.

> People choose to be unhappy.

> I have a young friend who dreams of becoming a novelist, but he never seems
to be able to complete his work. According to him, his job keeps him too busy,
and he can never find enough time to write novels, and that's why he can't
complete work and enter it for writing awards. But is that the real reason? No!
It's actually that he wants to leave the possibility of "I can do it if I try"
open, but not committing to anything ... He should just enter his writing for
an award, and if he gets rejected, so be it. If he did, he might grow, or
discover that he should pursue something different. Either way, he would be
able to move on.

> There's nothing bad about feelings of inferiority themselves ...
Everyone is in this "condition of wanting to improve" that is the
pursuit of superiority. One holds up various ideals or goals and
heads toward them. However, on not being able to reach one's
ideals, one harbors a sense of being lesser ... Adler is saying
that the pursuit of superiority and the feeling of inferiority,
too, can promote striving and growth.

> One wishes to be praised by someone. Or conversely, one decides to give
praise to someone. This is proof that one is seeing all interpersonal
relationships as "vertical relationships." ... Adlerian psychology refutes all
manner of vertical relationships and proposes that all interpersonal
relationships be horizontal relationships. In a sense, this point may be
regarded as the fundamental principle of Adlerian psychology.

> When we refer to the pursuit of superiority, there's a tendency
to think of it as the desire to try to be superior to other people;
to climb higher, even if it means kicking others down ... Adler
does not uphold such attitudes, of course. Rather, he's saying that
on the same level playing field, there are people who are moving
forward, and there are people who are moving forward behind them
... The pursuit of superiority is the mind-set of taking a single
step forward on one's own feet, not the mind-set of competition of
the sort that necessitates aiming to be greater than other people.

> I do not think about gaining status or honor, and I live my life as an
outsider philosopher without any connection whatsoever to worldly competition.

> Can you celebrate other people's happiness with all your heart?

> The interpersonal relationships that a single individual has no choice but to
confront when attempting to live as a social being—these are the life tasks.
They are indeed tasks in the sense that one has no choice but to confront them.

[TODO] Tasks of work, tasks of friendship, and tasks of love


> Adlerian psychology is a psychology for changing oneself, not a psychology
for changing others. Instead of waiting for others to change or waiting for the
situation to change, you take the first step forward yourself.

> When one can think, Whenever I am with this person, I can behave very freely,
one can really feel love. One can be in a calm and quite natural state, without
having feelings of inferiority or being beset with the need to flaunt one's
superiority.

> A parent suffering over the relationship with his or her child will tend to
think, 'My child is my life.' ... However, no matter how much of the burden of
the child's task one carries, the child is still an independent individual.
Children do not become what their parents want them to become. In their choices
of university, place of employment, and partner in marriage, and even in the
everyday subtleties of speech and conduct, they do not act according to their
parents' wishes.

The author explains how parents often force children to study, because it's
"for their own good". When this is deception, i.e. the parents are trying to
achieve their own goals, then children have every right to be frustrated. A
person should not be compelled to serve another's goals, to do so is to deprive
them of fundamental human rights.

> Whether the child studies or not. Whether he goes out and plays with his
friends or not. Essentially this is the child's task, not the parent's task ...
In general, all interpersonal relationship troubles are caused by intruding on
other people's tasks, or having one's own tasks intruded on ... If it's
studying that is the issue, one tells the child that that is his task, and one
lets him know that one is ready to assist him whenever he has the urge to
study. But one must not intrude on the child's task.

I.e. take as much responsibility for what you can, and none of what you cannot.
You'll suffer for your expectations because you cannot control other people's
actions.

> We are all suffering in interpersonal relationships. It might be the
relationship with one's parents or one's elder brother, and it might be the
interpersonal relationships at one's workplace ... Calmly delineate up to what
point one's own tasks go, and from what point they become another person's
tasks. And do not intervene in other people's tasks, or allow even a single
person to intervene in one's own tasks.

[TODO] Similar quote, "What I should do is face my own tasks in my own life
without lying."

> What should one do to not be disliked by anyone? There is only one answer: It
is to constantly gauge other people's feelings while swearing loyalty to all of
them ... If one is living in such a way as to satisfy other people's
expectations, and one is entrusting one's own life to others, that is a way of
living in which one is lying to oneself and continuing that lying to include
the people around one.

> The desire for recognition is probably a natural desire

This is an important concession. P thinks we are capable of overcoming this
inclination. If you can overcome it, which

> It is certainly distressful to be disliked. If possible, one would like to
live without being disliked by anyone. One wants to satisfy one's desire for
recognition. But conducting oneself in such a way as to not be disliked by
anyone is an extremely unfree way of living, and is also impossible. There is a
cost incurred when one wants to exercise one's freedom. And the cost of freedom
in interpersonal relationships is that one is disliked by other people ... What
I am saying is, don't be afraid of being disliked ... The courage to be happy
also includes the courage to be disliked. When you have gained that courage,
your interpersonal relationships will all at once change into things of
lightness.

> People who are obsessed with such a desire for recognition will seem to be
looking at other people, while they are actually looking only at themselves.
They lack concern for others and are concerned solely with the "I." Simply put
they are self-centered ... In the sense that you are concerned solely with the
"I," you are self-centered. You want to be thought well of by others, and that
is why you worry about the way they look at you. That is not concern for
others. It is nothing but attachment to self ... It is necessary to make the
switch from "attachment to self" to "concern for others" ... One needs to think
not, "What will this person give me?" but rather, "What can I give to this
person?" That is commitment to the community.

This is the aspect of the book I disliked the most. The driving function of
this teaching is about being happy, which is entirely egocentric. It is a
selfish pursuit. P out of nowhere suggests that it's not the individual that
matters, but others. He doesn't provide any basis for why that should be. It
contradicts with his earlier statement about being willing to be disliked. From
this perspective maybe one should satisfy other's expectations if one cares
more about them than one's self.

[TODO] All of us are searching for the sense of belonging, that "it's okay to
be here."

> Now, let's say it's your school, and your teacher has been behaving in an
authoritarian manner. But the power or authority your teacher wields are
nothing more than an aspect of the common sense that operates only within the
small community that is the school. From the standpoint of the community that
is "human society," both you and your teacher are equal humans. If unreasonable
demands are being thrust on you, it is fine to object to them directly.

[TODO] In Israel, everyone is required to serve in the military. Occasionally
this results in reversed hierarchical relationships. An employee may end up
giving military orders to their boss. I think it's worthwhile to maintain
perspective, that we are all part of a society of "humans", despite our roles
in more narrow societies.

> A mother praises her child who has helped her prepare dinner, saying, "You're
such a good helper!" But when her husband does the same things, you can be sure

I want to believe this is true, but I need to think about it some more. I can't
explain why I feel this is true.

ability ... Because giving praise is a judgement that is passed by a person of
ability onto a person without ability

> Being praised essentially means that one is receiving judgement from another

P says that we should appreciate other people not for their acts but simply for
the sake of existing. This is a rhetorical side step. This view is not
compatible with our purely selfish desires.

> Youth: ... If you put it the other way around, a person who isn't of any use
to others has no worth at all.

> If one is able to feel one has worth, then one can accept oneself just as one
is and have the courage to face one's life tasks ... That one can act on the
community, that is to say, on other people, and that one can feel "I am of use
to someone." ... It is at that point that, at last, we can have a true sense of
our own worth.

[TODO] The latter point needs to be clarified. What is the danger of avoiding
responsibility? The quote needs more context (p.198)

> In a company structure, it is only natural for there to be different levels
of responsibility. I am not telling you to make friends with everyone, or
behave as if you are close friends. Rather, what is important is to be equal in
consciousness, and to assert that which needs to be asserted ... If one is
gauging the atmosphere of a situation and being dependent on vertical
relationships, one is engaging in irresponsible acts—one is trying to avoid
one's responsibilities.

The latter point needs to be clarified. What is the danger of avoiding
responsibility? The quote needs more context (p.198)

Hierarchies are normal, because people have different aptitudes. P is
criticizing hierarchies of worth ("what is important is to be equal in
consciousness"). If people are equal, then it doesn't matter what people do,
which is an argument for appreciating people on the level of being.

[TODO partial self thought] The final goal of interpersonal relationships is
community feeling a sense of belonging, "that it's okay to be here"

P doesn't provide a satisfying answer here, what is the answer?

> First of all, let's look at what you were just saying, about your
self-consciousness putting the brakes on and not letting you behave in an
innocent way ... But I'll bet that when you're home alone, you sing out loud
and dance to music and speak in a lively voice ... It isn't that you don't have
an innocent self—it is only that you can't do such things in front of others
... Three things are needed at this point: "self-acceptance," "confidence in
others," and "contribution to others."

> Self-affirmation is making suggestions to oneself, such as "I can do it" or
"I am strong," even when something is simply beyond one's ability. It is a
notion that can bring about a superiority complex, and may even be termed a way
of living in which one lies to oneself. With self-acceptance, on the other
hand, if one cannot do something, one is simply accepting "one's incapable
self" as is and moving forward so that one can do whatever one can.

[TODO] How does this bring about a superiority complex?


> Suppose you have placed "doubt" at the foundation of your interpersonal
relations. That you live your life doubting other people—doubting your friends
and even your family and those you love. What sort of relationship could
possibly arise from that? The other person will detect the doubt in your eyes
in an instant. He or she will have an instinctive understanding that "this
person does not have confidence in me."

P states that unconditional trust is essential for building deep relationships.
He doesn't provide a reason, acting as if it's obvious. Implicitly he is
stating that trust is key to relationships. In my own head, trusting someone is
a huge statement of value. You trust yourself. Saying you trust someone else is
demonstrating willingness to accept risk on the basis of someone's character.
It's really placing a value judgement on someone's character, that their word
is as good as the deed being done. P didn't address this idea directly. It's
also sort of a shocking but silly thing. Trust should be earned. But in terms
of thought, we shouldn't accept the burden of someone else's task which is
following through with the obligation. We should do our best in our task which
is to have faith in them. It doesn't matter whether or not the other person
follows through with their task. This is a hard pill to swallow, but it's one
of the largest ideas in the book. Everyone has their own life tasks to fulfill.
Some relationships you can sever easily others you cannot. Rather then
experiencing the anguish of a compelled but sour relationship, one can take
refuge in the understanding that in the fulfillment of one's own tasks, one has
done all that they can.

There is an interesting consequence of the idea of "separating one's life
tasks". Be responsible for what you can and no more. When you trust someone in
some capacity, you set expectations and assume some risk. The fulfillment of
expectations are not something you're responsible for, so these expectations
are not something you'd want to depend on. p. 214

> It's been left to the wife (me) to do the dishes and clear everything up. To
make matters worse, the family takes that for granted, and one would think,
"Why won't they give me a hand? " or "Why do I have to do all the work?" Even
if I do not hear the words "thank you" from my family while I am cleaning up, I
want them to think that I am of use to the family. Instead of thinking about
what others can do for me, I want to think about, and put into practice, what I
can do for other people.

> There are not many people who will laugh at or make fun of someone when he
trips overs his words now and then ... It would probably be no more than one
person in ten, at most. In any case, with the sort of foolish person who would
take such an attitude, it is best to simply sever the relationship. But if one
is lacking in harmony of life, one will focus only on that person and end up
thinking, "Everyone is laughing at me."

> For each and every one of us, however, there comes a time when one can no
longer serve as the provider ... Those who can accept themselves only on the
level of acts are severely damaged ... Does one accept oneself on the level of
acts, or on the level of being? This is truly a question that relates to the
courage to be happy?

> For a human being, the greatest unhappiness is not being able to like
oneself. Adler came up with an extremely simple answer to address this reality.
Namely, that the feeling of "I am beneficial to the community" or "I am of use
to someone" is the only thing that can give one a true awareness that one has
worth ... You are not the one who decides if your contributions are of use.
That is the task of other people, and is not an issue in which you can
intervene. In principle, there is not even any way you can know whether you
have really made a contribution. That is to say, when we are engaging in this
contribution to others, the contribution does not have to be a visible one—all
we need is the subjective sense that "I am of use to someone," or in other
words, a feeling of contribution.

In our circles there are people who are astonishing. There is a sense of, "I
wish I could be like them." There are people we do not look up to. We're
constantly measuring and communicating worth. When someone is dominating the
conversation and is uninteresting, we look away or act disinterested. We build
hierarchies based on perceived worth. However, in each of our hierarchies we
must also place ourselves. Hierarchical structures, where the most competent
have the most influence, make sense for survival or business. They don't make
sense for how one measures one's worth, because no two people have the same
affinities. In fact, some people are better in every way that society measures
someone. Adlerian psychology suggests that we should forego hierarchies and
pursue horizontal relationships with regard to personal worth. There are two
possibilities. One possibility is that this isn't practical, that we have
outdated hardware. Hardware which is constantly judging and measuring and
organizing, that we cannot escape building hierarchies. The other possibility
is that we can feel worthwhile and view others as worthwhile outside of
hierarchies.

> Why is it necessary to be special? Probably because one cannot accept one's
normal self ... But is being normal, being ordinary, really such a bad thing?
Is it something inferior? ... Self-acceptance is the vital first step. If you
are able to possess the courage to be normal, your way of looking at the world
will change dramatically.

You may just be discontent with yourself, you may hope to lift your miserable
self up if only you can be special or do something great. This view is flawed
your real issue is not achieving some arbitrary thing but rather not accepting
yourself. Further, it is dangerous to treat one's life as en-route to some
summit. If you work hard and suffer for a better life, you're gambling with the
very thing you're trying to gain. If you're in danger or oppressed then this
trade may make sense, though is not a desirable situation to be in. If you're
life is cut short or you're unable to reach the summit, then you will not have
anything to show for your life. The alternative is to self-accept, to love
oneself, and to see life as a journey not the destination.

> You set objectives for the distant future, and think of now as your
preparatory period. You think. "I really want to do this, and I'll do it when
the time comes." This is is a way of living that postpones life. As long was we
postpone life, we can never go anywhere and will pass our days only one after
the next in dull monotony, because we think of here and now as just a
preparatory period, as a time for patience ... The greatest life-lie of all is
to not live here and now.

> What is the meaning of life? What are people living for? When someone posed
these questions to Adler, this was his answer: "Life in general has no

has no meaning whatsoever. But you can assign meaning to that life. And you
are the only one who can assign meaning to your life.
