A fundamental aspect of color perception is that colors influence one another.

<div id="root" style="margin-bottom:32px"></div>

In the above graphic, the inner squares are the same color, though
they appear different. This difference is caused by the influence of the
larger surrounding squares.

Here is another example where the only influence is value--how light and how dark.

<div id="black-and-white" style="margin-bottom:32px"></div>

Here is a more subtle example where the only influence is chroma--a measure of
pigment or saturation.

<div id="chroma" style="margin-bottom:32px"></div>

By clicking on any of the examples, you can alter the three areas of color.
And adjust the areas by hue, chroma, and value. You'll notice that some of the
scales have gaps in colors.  These gaps are colors that cannot be expressed in
your browser<a style="text-decoration:none" id="fn:1"

The general idea behind this color influence is that each color adds some of
its opposite to the other. In the above examples we've varied color by hue,
chroma, and value. In hue, a color influences another by adding some of the
hue that is 180 degrees around the color wheel. In chroma, a more saturated
color influences another color to look less saturated. In value, a darker
color makes another look lighter.

In the following example a gray background is chosen against a blue inner
square. This gray varies only in chroma from the blue, making the blue look
more saturated. Because of its similarity it's one of the least biasing that
is still neutral. If you focus your gaze down the middle, the blue on the left
looks even more blue.

<div id="complementary" style="margin-bottom:32px"></div>

This color influence (and this particular illusion) are a primary subject in
Josef Albers' _Interaction of Color_. Albers mentions that this effect may
have its origins in the brain improving perception by increasing contrast.

Hope you enjoy playing with the examples :).
